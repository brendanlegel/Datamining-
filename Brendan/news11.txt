Assemblyman Matthew Harper (R) asked. "This is ridiculous. This is insane."The bill would subsequently get rid of either George Washington or Abraham Lincoln's birthday as a holiday and designate May 1 as “International Workers’ Day."International Socialist Workers' Day, or "May Day" had been observed in countries under Communist rule and was an official holiday of the Soviet Union."Seriously, the substitution of adding International Socialist Workers' Day? May Day? The day of parades in the Soviet Union?" Harper said."I'm aghast that a bill like this would be able to get through committee.”— Matthew Harper (@AsmHarper) <a href="https://twitter.com/AsmHarper/status/994665321800888321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2018</a>Watch more above.<a href="/2018/05/12/students-dismiss-trump-nobel-prize-defend-barack-obamas-award"><strong>Students Dismiss Idea of Nobel Prize for Trump, Defend Obama's But Don't Know Why</strong></a><a href="/2018/05/12/new-jersey-bill-allows-illegal-immigrants-apply-financial-aid-rutgers-student-reacts"><strong>'Incentives to Break the Law': Student Rips 'Absurd' Bill Allowing Illegal Immigrants to Apply for Financial Aid</strong></a><a href="/2018/05/13/johnny-joey-jones-double-amputee-veteran-turned-away-va-without-treatment"><strong>'A Disinformation Campaign': Double-Amputee Vet Turned Away From VA Without Treatment</strong></a>Stay connected with the most-watched, most-trusted name in news.Stay connected with the most-watched, most-trusted name in news.Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on Saturday said that young voters' support for Democrats will hurt the millennial generation.A California assemblyman vehemently argued against a bill that would adopt International Workers’ Day as a paid holiday.Greg Gutfeld remembered a few of his summer jobs as a kid Saturday after a U.S. Bureau of Labor&nbsp;Statistics analysis found that fewer teens are looking for summer work.Conservative social media stars Diamond and Silk blasted the Democratic Party Sunday after the release of an anti-GOP political ad.Stay connected with the most-watched, most-trusted name in news.
