                                Matt Schlapp, the president of the American Conservative Union, responded to Griffin's 19-post Twitter thread about him and his wife by saying, &quot;Kathy I think it's time to move on now I'm getting a bit worried. Go away from the light.&quot;Griffin had called the Schlapps &quot;D.C.'s most spineless power couple&quot; and &quot;a bunch of suck-ups.&quot; She added that while she argued with Mercedes Schlapp over the after-dinner routine by comedian Michelle Wolf, &quot;Matt just stood there gingerly holding his drink and sucking up some sort of clear alcohol ... through a tiny straw like a gossipy little b----.&quot;Near the end of her rant, Griffin said: &quot;I actually don't think Matt and Mercedes believe in and support Trump. They just know where the power is in a room and that's why they attached themselves to Trump.<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/05/10/white-house-official-mocked-dying-mccain-after-haspel-criticism-sources-say.html"><b>WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL MOCKED 'DYING' MCCAIN AFTER HASPEL CRITICISM, SOURCES SAY</b></a>&quot;After Trump ends up wherever he ends up they'll find the next opportunity by selling their souls yet again,&quot; she concluded before directing a final blast at Mercedes Schlapp. &quot;I can sleep at night [but] your support of a monster and your hypocrisy will stick with you for the rest of your life.&quot;Griffin said sh<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/05/08/kathy-griffin-claims-shes-on-kill-list-whines-still-shuns-her-for-trump-mask-picture.html"><b>KATHY GRIFFIN CLAIMS SHE'S ON A 'KILL LIST,' SAYS INDUSTRY STILL SHUNS HER FOR TRUMP MASK PICTURE</b></a>The sources said Sadler told her colleagues that McCain's opposition to Haspel &quot;doesn't matter, he's dying anyway.&quot;Griffin drew public backlash after she posed with a bloodied mask of President Trump's face in May 2017.
