Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/994587349718847489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2018</a>Trump also made the announcement just hours after he welcomed home three American prisoners released by North Korea's capital, Pyongyang."That's a joke," one student said of the idea of President Trump receiving the award. "What has he done for peace?""I feel like he just thinks that he deserves many awards and that's just stupid," another student said.The students added that Obama deserved his award, but could not tell Phillips what he did to deserve it.— Campus Reform (@campusreform) <a href="https://twitter.com/campusreform/status/995270922901819392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2018</a>"It's not that these students are forgetting obvious reasons, there just wasn't that much to go on in the first place," Phillips said.Some have argued that since President Trump's breakthrough with Kim Jong Un, the potential for denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula warrants the Nobel Peace Prize.Phillips said that if Obama had achieved denuclearization, "they would have already renamed the prize the 'Obama Peace Prize.'"Watch more from "Fox &amp; Friends" above.<a href="/2018/04/21/donald-trump-north-korea-progress-would-earn-nobel-peace-prize-lee-zeldin-praises"><strong>'He'd Be Earning the Nobel Peace Prize': Rep.
