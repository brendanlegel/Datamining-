                                “In all seriousness, I think that having kids is great preparation for anything – especially a job you need patience for and they have certainly prepared me for this one,” said Sanders, in the Mother's Day interview that also included White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway and White House Strategic Communications Director Mercedes Schlapp.The 35-year-old Sanders also expressed gratitude that her children are still too young to read “some of the negative stories that exist out there,” and that she tries to protect them from such backlash as much as possible – while offering some words of wisdom for other working moms.“I try to make sure I’m very intentional with the time that I have with my kids,” Sanders continued. “I’m gonna miss some of the moments, but the ones that I do have, I really try to focus on them, put my phone aside, block out some of the stress of work and really focus my time and attention on what they want to talk about and really zero in on them.”<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/05/04/sarah-sanders-on-michelle-wolfs-jokes-wish-her-happiness.html" target="_blank">SARAH SANDERS ON MICHELLE WOLF'S JOKES: I WISH HER 'HAPPINESS'</a><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/05/06/sarah-sanders-touts-trump-cia-pick-haspel-blasts-hypocrite-dems-who-oppose-nominee.html" target="_blank">SARAH SANDERS TOUTS TRUMP CIA PICK HASPEL, BLASTS 'HYPOCRITE' DEMS WHO OPPOSE NOMINEE</a>And as much as the prominent White House figure values working with the Trump administration, she emphasized that it was not the most crucial role in her life.“I love my job. It’s an honor to work for the president, but there are a lot of people that have had this job before and there are a lot of people who are going to have it after,” Sanders added. “The most important, influential job I have is being a mom. There are a number of people who can do the job I have. Only one person can be the mom to my kids. So that’s certainly the most important and influential role I’ll ever have. I’m trying hard not to screw it up.”Hollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.
